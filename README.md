### SharkBot
  
This is a telegram bot, who uses key, value json to reply and say funny phrases on any channel  
you want to add him...

This bot was firstly created to be a funny bot at [GaragemHacker Curitiba HackerSpace](http://garagemhacker.org) group.
The main objective here is implement some level of decision tree which can be used to moderate  
users on a Telegram, but in a very funny way, with some jokes and clever phrases :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. It can also,
reply users in a randon way searching the context in phrases and say something that can match with  
it's own vocabullary.
I have also created some level of histeresis, which is used to do not disturb a lot with the same moderation  
pharse. :wink:  
  
### How to use
  
At the point I'm writing this README this bot doens't have yet a yaml file,_(_ which will be a very nice improvemente on this bot_ ). So to use this bot you must set only two variables:  
  
`token` must be setted to your bot token as string.  
`myid` must be setted with your bot id.  
  
You can also adjust the pharses and create more phrase by change the file `phrases.json`
